About loader:
"sideload-DLL.dll" is vanilla-dll-sideloader: https://github.com/allfoxwy/vanilla-dll-sideloader
It is capable of loading other mobs such as VanillaFixes, VanillaMultiMonitorFix, etc....
You could add mod names which you wish to load into "dlls.txt", such as "VfPatcher.dll", "UnitXP_SP3.dll", etc...
Currently as there is not very much mods available, the loading sequence order is free for all. There is no known conflict yet.

Also, you could use VanillaFixes loader to load UnitXP_SP3 either.
Both VanillaFixes loader and vanilla-dll-sideloader read the same "dlls.txt" file to decide which mod to load.
And both of them is capable of loading each other.
Pick the one you like.
