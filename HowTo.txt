This program add sideload memory mods capability to WoW.exe

You could put it under same folder with WoW.exe, and run "Enable sideload-DLL.exe" to generate "WoW_sideload-DLL.exe". It's a one-time enable step. You could then start game with generated WoW_sideload-DLL.exe.

Currently it would try load VfPatcher.dll nampower.dll SuperWoWhook.dll VanillaMultiMonitorFix.dll

You could delete "Enable sideload-DLL.exe" after enabling. This file is huge because Node.js is big nowdays. My working code in it is in fact less than 15kb.
