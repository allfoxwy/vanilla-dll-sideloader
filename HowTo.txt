This program add sideload memory-mods capability to WoW.exe

You could put it under same folder with WoW.exe, and run "Enable sideload-DLL.exe" to generate "WoW_sideload-DLL.exe". It's an one-time enabling step. You could then start game with generated WoW_sideload-DLL.exe.

It would try load ".dll" files with "Vanilla1121mod" in their name when game start.

You could delete "Enable sideload-DLL.exe" after enabling. This file is huge because Node.js is big nowdays.
